// ui/changelog.js — the in-app changelog viewer, and the advanced date filter
// that this module and ui/historypanel.js share.
//
// Two things live here:
//
//   1. THE DATE FILTER. An anchored calendar with month/year jump, range
//      selection and named presets, paired with two typed fields that accept
//      the locale's own format *and* plain ISO. A partial or invalid entry is
//      reported inline and the user's text is kept exactly as typed — the one
//      behaviour that separates a date picker people trust from one they fight.
//      `ui/historypanel.js` imports `createDateRangeFilter` from here so the
//      two surfaces are literally the same control rather than two that look
//      alike and drift apart.
//
//   2. THE CHANGELOG VIEWER. Every recorded version, filtered by date AND by
//      search — the two COMPOSE, so narrowing by date never throws the search
//      away and vice versa. Copy and export honour whatever is on screen and
//      the exported file states its range, because a changelog extract with no
//      stated range is a document nobody can check later.
//
// HONESTY. The content below is not written to fill a page. No release has been
// published for this project yet, so `CHANGELOG.releases` is empty and the
// viewer says so instead of inventing a 1.0. What it can show truthfully is the
// build it is running in, and the development history recorded in the
// repository — each entry carrying the commit that produced it, so every line
// is checkable against `git show`.
